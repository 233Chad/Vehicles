## How to download?

The plugin works on all versions from 1.12.2 - 1.18.1, **excluding 1.14.x**!

- Latest stable releases are always published on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/80910/">Spigot.org</a>.
- **Download the resource pack.** Link can be found on our <a href="https://discord.gg/vehicle">Discord server</a> (We've created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSXNd-6rhQk">YouTube tutorial</a>).

You may set it as a server resource pack, or everyone would have to download the resource pack individually.

```
The vehicles WON'T look properly without the resource pack.
```

- Put the downloaded plugin into your server's `plugins/` folder.
- Restart the server.
- **Et voilà, it's working!** Don't forget to set your language using `/vehicle language`.

### Be aware!
```
We support ALL LATEST PATCH VERSIONS of Spigot/Paper 1.12+, excluding 1.14.4.
This means that 1.16.5 IS supported, whereas 1.16.3 is not (and similarly with all other versions).
```
If your server minecraft version is not supported by the plugin, it won't load.

Versions 1.12.1 and lower are not, and will not be supported.<br>
(Did you know that 1.8 was released in 2014? And some people still use it! Whoa.)
